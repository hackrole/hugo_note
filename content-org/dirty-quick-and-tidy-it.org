* backend

the failure in manager knobs project, A project for the dirty work.

* the reason

** workflow error

   the bad workflow
   
   #+begin_src plantuml
     @startuml
     "start code" -> "while code try to restruct the code"
     "after code finish" -> "write test for the code or skip this just to deploy and test it by hand"
     "the configure raise and origin design error"

     @enduml
   #+end_src
   
   the maybe-bettter workflow
   
   #+begin_src plantuml
     @startuml
     "get overview about the code, start write design-doc or just collect it"
     "first try out the dependance-service, by use django-shell or python-script"
     "write code or test, maybe TDD is ready now"

     @enduml
   #+end_src
   
   the reason for this is forget to do research, the dirty work maybe superise you in any ways.
   write code too fast may fail you. first try to play with it, after you collection all need-blocks, the coding will be enjoyable.

* something considable

** maybe literate-programming??

** start TDD very early may seems hard, better and research and play-around, it may be much easier.
